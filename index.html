  </header>
  <p>
A Privacy Policy is a statement or legal document (in the Privacy Act) that discloses some or all of the information that a party collects, uses, discloses and manages customer data.
Personal information can be anything that identifies a person's name, address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue, and expiration date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where not limited. 
One can be used for travel, and for the purpose of acquiring products and services. In the case of a business it is often a statement announcing policies about how it collects, stores and discloses personal information. 
It notifies the client of any specific information that is collected and kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other companies or enterprises. 
Privacy policies typically represent a broader, more generalized treatment than data usage statements, which tend to be more detailed and specific.<br><br>

The exact content of specific privacy policies can rely upon applicable law and address needs across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdiction.
Most countries have their own laws and pointers on UN agency is roofed, what info will be collected, and what it will be used for. 
In general, knowledge protection laws in Europe cowl the personal sector, in addition because the public sector. 
Their privacy laws apply not solely to government activities, however additionally to personal enterprises and business transactions.<br><br>

<h2 >History</h2>
</header>
In 1968, the Council of Europe began studying the effects of technology on human technology, recognizing new threats posed by computer technology that had not previously been widely available.
In 1969, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began examining the effects of leaving personal information.
As a result, the council recommended policies for the protection of personal information, both private and public, which led to Convention 108.
In 1981, the Privacy Convention (Convention 108) was introduced to protect personal information.
One of the first privacy laws enacted was the Swedish Data Act in 1973, then the West German Data Protection Act in 1977, and the French law on informatics, data banking and independence in 1978.
<br><br>
In the United States, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was passed in the late 1960s and 1970s due to concerns over privacy policy.
Although this law was not created as a privacy law, it does allow customers to check their credit files and correct errors.
It also imposes restrictions on the use of information in credit records. In the late 1960's, a number of congressional study groups experimented with increasing ease with which personal information could be automatically collected and matched with other information.
One of these groups is an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which developed a policy in 1973 called Fair Information Practices.
The work of the advisory committee led to the Privacy Act in 1974. In 1980, the United States signed the Guidelines for Economic Cooperation and Development.
<br><br>
In Canada, a Privacy Commissioner of Canada was established under the Canadian Human Rights Act in 1977.
In 1982, the appointment of a Privacy Commissioner was part of the new Privacy Act. Canada signed the OECD guidelines in 1984.
<br><br>

<header class="section-header">
<h2 >Fair information practice</h2>
</header>

There are significant differences between the EU data protection and US data privacy laws.
These standards must be met not only by businesses operating in the EU but also by any organization that transfers personal information collected concerning citizens of the EU.
In 2001 the United States Department of Commerce worked to ensure legal compliance for US organizations under an opt-in Safe Harbor Program.
The FTC has approved TRUSTe to certify streamlined compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor.
<br><br>

<header class="section-header">
<h2 >Current enforcement</h2>
</header>


In 1995 the European Union (EU) introduced the Data Protection Directive[5] for its member states.
As a result, many organizations doing business within the EU began to draft policies to comply with this Directive.
In the same year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published the Fair Information Principles which provided a set of non-binding governing principles for the commercial use of personal information.
While not mandating policy, these principles provided guidance of the developing concerns of how to draft privacy policies.
<br><br>
The United States does not have a specific federal regulation establishing universal implementation of privacy policies.
Congress has, at times, considered comprehensive laws regulating the collection of information online, such as the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act and the Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001, but none have been enacted.
In 2001, the FTC stated an express preference for "more law enforcement, not more laws" and promoted continued focus on industry self-regulation.
<br><br>
In many cases, the FTC enforces the terms of privacy policies as promises made to consumers using the authority granted by Section 5 of the FTC Act which prohibits unfair or deceptive marketing practices.
The FTC's powers are statutorily restricted in some cases; for example, airlines are subject to the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),and cell phone carriers are subject to the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
<br><br>
In some cases, private parties enforce the terms of privacy policies by filing class action lawsuits, which may result in settlements or judgments.
However, such lawsuits are often not an option, due to arbitration clauses in the privacy policies or other terms of service agreements.
<br><br>

<header class="section-header">
<h2 >Applicable law</h2>
</header>
<h3>United States</h3>
Main article: Privacy laws of the United States
While no generally applicable law exists, some federal laws govern privacy policies in specific circumstances, such as:

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) affects websites that knowingly collect information about or targeted at children under the age of 13.
Any such websites must post a privacy policy and adhere to enumerated information-sharing restrictions COPPA includes a "safe harbor" provision to promote Industry self-regulation.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires institutions "significantly engaged" in financial activities give "clear, conspicuous, and accurate statements" of their information-sharing practices.
The Act also restricts use and sharing of financial information.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules requires notice in writing of the privacy practices of health care services, and this requirement also applies if the health service is electronic.
Some states have implemented more stringent regulations for privacy policies.
The California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 – Business and Professions Code sections 22575-22579 requires "any commercial websites or online services that collect personal information on California residents through a web site to conspicuously post a privacy policy on the site".[22] Both Nebraska and Pennsylvania have laws treating misleading statements in privacy policies published on websites as deceptive or fraudulent business practices.[23]
<br><br>

<h3 >Canada</h3>

Canada's federal Privacy Law applicable to the private sector is formally referred to as Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).
The purpose of the act is to establish rules to govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by commercial organizations.
The organization is allowed to collect, disclose and use the amount of information for the purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstance.
<br><br>
The Act establishes the Privacy Commissioner of Canada as the Ombudsman for addressing any complaints that are filed against organizations.
The Commissioner works to resolve problems through voluntary compliance, rather than heavy-handed enforcement.
The Commissioner investigates complaints, conducts audits, promotes awareness of and undertakes research about privacy matters.
<br><br>

<h3 >European Union</h3>

Main articles: General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Directive
The right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in Europe. All the member states of the European Union (EU) are also signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his correspondence", subject to certain restrictions.
The European Court of Human Rights has given this article a very broad interpretation in its jurisprudence.
<br><br>
In 1980, in an effort to create a comprehensive data protection system throughout Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued its "Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data".
The seven principles governing the OECD’s recommendations for protection of personal data were:
<br><br>
1. Notice—data subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected;
2. Purpose—data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes;
3. Consent—data should not be disclosed without the data subject's consent;
4. Security—collected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses;
5. Disclosure—data subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data;
6. Access—data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data; and
7. Accountability—data subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable for not following the above principles.
8. The OECD guidelines, however, were nonbinding, and data privacy laws still varied widely across Europe.
The US, while endorsing the OECD’s recommendations, did nothing to implement them within the United States.
However, all seven principles were incorporated into the EU Directive.
<br><br>
In 1995, the EU adopted the Data Protection Directive, which regulates the processing of personal data within the EU.
There were significant differences between the EU data protection and equivalent U.S. data privacy laws.
These standards must be met not only by businesses operating in the EU but also by any organization that transfers personal information collected concerning a citizen of the EU.
In 2001 the United States Department of Commerce worked to ensure legal compliance for US organizations under an opt-in Safe Harbor Program.
The FTC has approved a number of US providers to certify compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor.
Since 2010 Safe Harbor is criticised especially by German publicly appointed privacy protectors because the FTC's will to assert the defined rules hadn't been implemented in a proper even after revealing disharmonies.
Effective 25 May 2018, the Data Protection Directive is superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which harmonizes privacy rules across all EU member states.
GDPR imposes more stringent rules on the collection of personal information belonging to EU data subjects, including a requirement for privacy policies to be more concise, clearly-worded, and transparent in their disclosure of any collection, processing, storage, or transfer of personally identifiable information.
Data controllers must also provide the opportunity for their data to be made portable in a common format, and for it to be erased under certain circumstances.
<br><br>


<h3 >Australia</h3>

Main article: Privacy Act 1988
The Privacy Act 1988 provides the legal framework for privacy in Australia.It includes a number of national privacy principles.
<br></br>


<h3 >India</h3>

The Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 made significant changes to the Information Technology Act, 2000, introducing Section 43A.
This section provides compensation in the case where a corporate body is negligent in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures and thereby causes wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person. This applies when a corporate body possesses, deals or handles any sensitive personal data or information in a computer resource that it owns, controls or operates.
In 2011, the Government of India prescribed the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011[34] by publishing it in the Official Gazette.[35] These rules require a body corporate to provide a privacy policy for handling of or dealing in personal information including sensitive personal data or information.[36] Such a privacy policy should consist of the following information in accordance with the rules:
<br></br>
Clear and easily accessible statements of its practices and policies;
Type of personal or sensitive personal data or information collected;
Purpose of collection and usage of such information;
Disclosure of information including sensitive personal data or information;
Reasonable security practices and procedures.
The privacy policy should be published on the website of the body corporate, and be made available for view by providers of information who have provided personal information under lawful contract.
<br><br>

<h3 >Online privacy certification programs</h3>


Online certification or "seal" programs are an example of industry self-regulation of privacy policies.
Seal programs usually require implementation of fair information practices as determined by the certification program and may require continued compliance monitoring.
TRUSTArc (formerly TRUSTe), the first online privacy seal program, included more than 1,800 members by 2007 Other online seal programs include the Trust Guard Privacy Verified program,eTrust,and Webtrust.
